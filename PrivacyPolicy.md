This Chrome extension, _Summ_, values your privacy.
We do not collect, transmit, or share any personal information with external servers.

## Information We Access

_Summ_ may access limited webpage data such as:  
- The current Netflix title, episode name, and playback progress.  
- The page title of the active tab.

You may optionally enter your own Google Gemini API key, which is stored locally using Chrome’s storage.local.
This key never leaves your device and is used only to make direct requests from your browser to Google’s API.

## How Information Is Used

The accessed data is used solely to generate summaries or reviews for the content you are viewing.  
All data handling occurs locally within your browser.  
No data is transmitted, collected, or shared with the developer or any third party.

## Third-Party Services

API requests are sent directly from your browser to Google’s Generative Language API using your API key.  
Your interactions with that API are subject to Google’s Privacy Policy.

## Permissions Used

- storage: to securely store your API key locally.
- activeTab: to detect if you are currently on a Netflix page.
- scripting: to retrieve episode information for summarization.
- Host permission (https://www.netflix.com/*): to read limited page details such as show title and episode information.
  
These permissions are used only to provide the core user-facing functionality and not for analytics or advertising.

## Data Sharing

We do not collect, sell, or share user data with any third parties.

## Data Security

All communication with external APIs occurs over HTTPS.  
Data stored locally is sandboxed within Chrome and never transmitted externally.
