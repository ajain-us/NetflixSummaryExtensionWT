## About
This project is an extension for Chrome. It works when you are on netflix in Google Chrome. The menu allows you to generate a summary of what the current show is about or a review based on what is online.

## Downloading
When you first load into the extension, it will ask you to enter a gemini API key. This can be generated at https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys. After you login, please press "Create API key" found in the top right of the webpage. After this it will ask you to name the key. We reccomend that you name it "Netflix Summary Extension", but any name will work. Then click on the "Choose an imported project" drop down menu. From there, click create project and name the project "NSEE". After naming the project, please select it from the drop down menu and press "Create Key" in the bottom right. After creating the key, please press the "copy api key" button. Then paste this api key in the field named "Gemini API key" and click enter!. If you are confused, please follow this youtube tutorial: (will be added later).
## Usage
To use this extension, select a TV show or movie within Netflix that you would like information about. Then simply select the extension from the Chrome extension selector. It will open a popup window that has two buttons, Summary and Review. From there, your request gets generated and displayed.
