## About
This project is an extension for Chrome. It works when you are on netflix in Google Chrome. The menu allows you to generate a summary of what the current show is about or a review based on what is online.

## Downloading
You can use this extension by adding a file called "apikey.js" in the popup folder. This file should contain the following: "const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY';". Please replace 'YOUR_KEY' with a Google Gemini API key. This can be gotten for free from: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key. From there you can simply add the extenions folder to Google Extensions. 

## Usage
To use this extension, select a TV show or movie that you would like information about. Then simply select the extension from the Chome extension selector. It will open a popup window that has two buttons, Summary and Review. From there, your request gets generated and displayed.
