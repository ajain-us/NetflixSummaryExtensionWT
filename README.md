## About
This project is an extension for the Chrome web browser. It works when you are on Netflix in Google Chrome. This will NOT work for any app versions of Netflix.

## Functionality
The "Summary" button will only summarize what has been viewed on the current account and will not spoil any future episodes or seasons. For movies, it will summarize up to the timestamp. If no progress has been made in the selected show or movie, a general summary will be generated spoiler free.  
  
The "Review" button will generate a review of the overall show/movie ending it with a rating out of 5.

## Downloading
By following the intructions below, you will generate a key that gives the ability to externally call Google's AI, Gemini. Following these steps will ensure that you will not be billed for the use of your key.  
  
When you first load into the extension, it will ask you to enter a Gemini API key. This can be generated at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys 

- After you login, please press "Create API key" found in the top right of the webpage.
- After, it will ask you to name the key. We recommend that you name it "Netflix Summary Extension", but any name will work.
- Then, click on the "Choose an imported project" drop down menu.
- From there, click create project and name the project "NSEE".
- After naming the project, please select it from the drop down menu and press "Create Key" in the bottom right.
- After creating the key, please press the "copy api key" button.
- Then paste this api key in the field named "Gemini API key" and click enter!.
